    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of social-media discussions has grown to be an important tool for biomedical informatics researchers, particularly for addressing questions relevant to public perceptions of health and related matters. Studies have examination of a range of topics at the intersection of health and social media, including studies of how [Facebook might be used to commuication health information](http://www.jmir.org/2016/8/e218/) how Tweets might be used to understand how smokers perceive [e-cigarettes, hookahs and other emerging smoking products](https://www.jmir.org/2013/8/e174/), and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although each investigation has unique aspects, studies of social media generally share several common tasks. Data acquisition is often the first challenge: although some data may be freely available, there are often [limits](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limits) as to how much data can be queried easily. Researchers might look out for [opportunities for accessing larger amounts of data](https://www.wired.com/2014/02/twitter-promises-share-secrets-academia/). Some studies contract with [commercial services providing fee-based access](https://gnip.com). \n",
    "\n",
    "Once a data set is in hand, the next step is often to identify key terms and phrases relating to the research question. Messages might be annotated to indicate specific categorizations of interest - indicating, for example, if a message referred to a certain aspect of a disease or symptom. Similarly, key words and phrases regularly occurring in the content might also be identified. Natural language and text processing techniques might be used to extract key words, phrases, and relationships, and machine learning tools might be used to build classifiers capable of distinguishing between types of tweets of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "This module presents a preliminary overview of these techniques, using Python 3 and several auxiliary libraries to explore the application of these techniques to Twitter data. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Part 1](SocialMedia%20-%20Part%201.ipynb) will cover the basics of retrieving data\n",
    "  \n",
    "  1. Configuration of tools to access Twitter data\n",
    "  2. Twitter data retrieval\n",
    "  3. Searching for tweets\n",
    "  \n",
    "[Part 2](SocialMedia%20-%20Part%202.ipynb) will cover annotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Part 3](SocialMedia%20-%20Part%203.ipynb) will discuss analysis through natural language processing and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Part 4](SocialMedia%20-%20Part%204.ipynb) introduces basic classifiers and suggests how they might be used to classify tweets. Evaluation of classifiers is also discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Part 5](SocialMedia%20-%20Part%204.ipynb) provides an exercise that ties all of this material togethers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our case study will apply these topics to Twitter discussions of smoking and vaping. Although details of the tools used to access data and the format and content of the data may differ for various services, the strategies and procedures used to analyze the data will generalize to other tools.\n",
